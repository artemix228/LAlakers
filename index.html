                <p class="text_kobe">Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbiː/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[3][4][5][6] Bryant won five NBA championships, and was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP. Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time postseason scoring lists. <br> 
                <br>

Born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy, Bryant was recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the U.S. while at Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania. The son of former NBA player Joe Bryant, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft after graduation, and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick; the Hornets then traded him to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, and he was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault,[7] with criminal charges eventually being dropped after the accuser refused to testify, with a lawsuit later settled out of court. Bryant denied the assault charge, but admitted to a sexual encounter and issued a public apology. <br>
<br>

After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second most points scored in a single game in league history, behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant led the team to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, and was named NBA Finals MVP on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in the league through 2013, when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon at age 34. He subsequently suffered season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively, in the following two seasons. Citing physical decline, Bryant retired after the 2015–16 season . <br>
<br>

Bryant is the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. He was also the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four All-Star Game MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname "Black Mamba" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, he won two gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team. In 2018, he won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for his 2017 film Dear Basketball. <br>
<br>

Bryant died at age 41, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others, due to blunt force trauma sustained from a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.[9] A number of tributes and memorials were subsequently issued, while the All-Star Game MVP award was renamed in his honor. </p>

               Los Angeles Lakers, American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers are one of the most successful and popular professional franchises in all American sports. The franchise has won a combined 16 Basketball Association of America (BAA) and National Basketball Association (NBA) titles, second in league history to their rival the Boston Celtics.
              <br>
              <br>
               The franchise that would become the Lakers was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL). The team moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1947, and its name was changed to the Lakers to reflect the Minnesota state nickname, “Land of 10,000 Lakes.” That same year the Lakers acquired George Mikan, who became professional basketball’s first dominant “big man” and the first in a series of great Laker centres. The Lakers joined the BAA (the official precursor of the NBA) for the 1948–49 season and won the final BAA championship. The NBA was formed in 1949, and Mikan and the Lakers—which also featured future Hall of Famers Jim Pollard, Slater Martin, Vern Mikkelsen, and (from 1953) Clyde Lovellette—won four of the first five league titles, establishing professional basketball’s first dynasty.
               <br>
               <br>
               
               The Lakers then entered a period of a relative lack of success, which reached its nadir in 2012–13. The team added perennial All-Stars Steve Nash and Dwight Howard in the preseason and was considered one of the favourites to win the championship, but it muddled through an inconsistent and injury-plagued campaign that ended with the team’s being swept out of the playoffs in the first round. Howard left in free agency in the off-season, and Bryant and Nash both missed most of the next season with injuries, which greatly contributed to the Lakers’ posting a losing record in 2013–14. Bryant missed much of the following season with another injury, and the Lakers struggled to a 21–61 record. The team was even worse in 2015–16, going a franchise-worst 17–65 in Bryant’s final season before his retirement. The team’s record improved by nine wins in 2016–17, but the extension of the Lakers’ franchise-record playoff drought to four seasons led to a front-office shake-up, which included Magic Johnson’s taking over as the team’s president of basketball operations. Johnson helped lure superstar free agent LeBron James to the Lakers during the 2018 off-season, but the team failed to significantly improve, and Johnson abruptly resigned at the end of the 2018–19 season.
